# Runbook — STRICT_TENANT_REFUSE flip

> Tenancy retro B4 (PR #476 — `requires_tenant` tag + `STRICT_TENANT_REFUSE` flag).
> Follow-up adversarial-pass blockers fixed in branch `phase0/zeta/476-blockers-pre-flip`.
> Earliest planned flip: **2026-05-28** (1-week log-only soak after PR #476 merged 2026-05-21 / commit `fe88135`).

## What this controls

`STRICT_TENANT_REFUSE` gates how `apps.workers.base.TenantAwareTask`
handlers behave when a Redis Streams entry arrives with empty / invalid
`resolved_tenant_id` AND the handler's `requires_tenant` is `True`
(the conservative default for every subclass).

| Mode | Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Log-only (Phase 0 default) | `False` | Handler proceeds against `tenant_scope(None)`. ERROR logged. `worker.tenant_required_missing` event audited. Same effective behaviour as pre-B4 (handlers ran against phantom tenant) — just loud. |
| Strict (post-soak) | `True` | Handler refuses to run. `TenantRequiredButMissing` raises. The consumer does not XACK; **the entry stays in the PEL**. No automatic DLQ. |

## ⚠ Flip requires worker restart

`config/settings/base.py` reads:

```python
STRICT_TENANT_REFUSE = os.environ.get("STRICT_TENANT_REFUSE", "false").lower() == "true"
```

**at module import time only.** After that, `settings.STRICT_TENANT_REFUSE`
is a static attribute on the settings module. The per-message read in
`apps.workers.base.TenantAwareTask.__call__` (`getattr(settings,
"STRICT_TENANT_REFUSE", False)`) returns the **import-frozen** value,
NOT the live env var.

Changing `STRICT_TENANT_REFUSE` in `/etc/ai-bot-platform/.env` therefore
has **no effect on running workers** until they are restarted. This is
the same pattern as Sprint 8 / F2 `STRICT_TENANT_SCOPE` — operationally
familiar but easy to miss for the B4 flag because the surrounding code
LOOKS hot-reloadable (per-message read of `settings.X`).

## ⚠ No automatic DLQ retry

There is **no XAUTOCLAIM-based reaper** in this codebase as of 2026-05-21.
When strict mode rejects a tenant-required handler, the entry sits in
the PEL indefinitely until operator intervention. XREADGROUP's `>` ID
returns only NEW entries, so the rejected entry will not redeliver on
its own.

Operator-side options when an entry lands in the PEL:

1. `XCLAIM` the entry to a separate diagnostic consumer, decide if it
   should be replayed (with a correctly-resolved `resolved_tenant_id`)
   or dropped (XACK after manual decision).
2. Wait for the planned XAUTOCLAIM reaper PR (follow-up issue, no
   timeline yet) to automate stale-PEL drain.

The XAUTOCLAIM reaper is **out of scope** for the
`phase0/zeta/476-blockers-pre-flip` PR. It is on the Phase 1 backlog
and MUST be filed as a separate issue before the strict-mode flip if
the planned manual-claim path is not acceptable for the chosen
deployment.

## Flip sequence (operator)

When the pre-flip checklist below is satisfied:

1. Set in `/etc/ai-bot-platform/.env`:
   ```
   STRICT_TENANT_REFUSE=true
   STRICT_TENANT_REFUSE_FLIP_AT=<ISO 8601 UTC, exactly now>
   ```
2. **Restart every worker process** running `python -m apps.workers.consumer --forever`.
   Standard pattern: `systemctl restart ai-bot-workers@*`.
3. Verify with `journalctl -u ai-bot-workers@* | grep STRICT_TENANT_REFUSE`
   that workers picked up the new value (or via a `worker.consumed`
   event audit query after the restart timestamp).
4. Watch `worker.tenant_required_missing` audit events for the 24h
   post-flip window. Any legitimate handler that surfaces here must
   either gain a `requires_tenant=False` opt-out (with docstring
   justification) OR the upstream ingress must learn to resolve its
   tenant before enqueuing.

## Pre-flip checklist (must pass before 2026-05-28)

- [ ] PR `phase0/zeta/476-blockers-pre-flip` merged.
- [ ] At least 7 consecutive days of `worker.tenant_required_missing`
      events triaged — zero legitimate handlers in the list.
- [ ] All registered `TenantAwareTask` subclasses audited for their
      effective `requires_tenant` value (B2 boot-audit logging is a
      planned follow-up; until it lands, audit via
      `grep -rn 'class.*TenantAwareTask' apps/` + manual review).
- [ ] XAUTOCLAIM reaper issue filed (or operator-side manual-claim
      runbook accepted as the post-flip PEL drain path).
- [ ] Dev-team comms about the **worker-restart-required** flip
      semantics so nobody thinks the env-var flip is hot.

## STRICT_TENANT_REFUSE × STRICT_TENANT_SCOPE coupling

> Adversarial-pass design issue #5 (PR #476 follow-up).

The two flags interact at the handler boundary:

- `requires_tenant=False` handlers run with `tenant_scope(None)`.
- Under `STRICT_TENANT_SCOPE=strict`, any ORM read from inside
  `tenant_scope(None)` against a tenant-scoped manager (the default
  `Model.objects` on a `tenancy.TenantScopedManager`-backed model)
  raises `CrossTenantError`.

⇒ **Mandate:** every `requires_tenant=False` handler MUST use the
`Model.all_tenants` escape-hatch manager for its DB reads, not
`Model.objects`. This is documented at the W900/W901 system check
sites; the existing `_IGNORE_TENANT_MANAGER_CHECK = True` opt-out
pattern (see `apps/eventbus/models.py`, `apps/events/models.py`,
`apps/tools/models.py`) is the canonical reference.

Timeline coupling: **do not** flip `STRICT_TENANT_REFUSE` to True
inside the same 24h window as a `STRICT_TENANT_SCOPE` flip. Soak
one, flip it, observe for 24h, then move to the other. The post-flip
monitor windows (`STRICT_SCOPE_FLIP_AT` and `STRICT_TENANT_REFUSE_FLIP_AT`)
must not overlap.

## Rollback

Revert `STRICT_TENANT_REFUSE=false` in `/etc/ai-bot-platform/.env`,
restart workers. No data migration. Any entries already in the PEL
from the strict window remain — either drain manually via XCLAIM /
XACK, or wait for the XAUTOCLAIM reaper.
